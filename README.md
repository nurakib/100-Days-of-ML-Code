# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
A repository dedicated to the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge.

## Earliest Motivation

* I have heard Machine Learning long ago, the idea of implicitly getting the insights from data and using that method to solve real-world problems is always intriguing to dive in deep. I was thinking, last few days about a dedicated study track for 'learning' machine learning stuff. At the beginning of 2020 seems a good point to start the long-cherished inclination. 

* This track includes getting the idea of behind scenario and intuition of most common Machine Learning algorithms and implementing the theoretical ideas into working code. I will list downs papers, MOOCs, books, and other resources for 100 days. 

* Happy Learning also Happy New Year.

  **Progress:** 
  
  1. Listing Down all the MOOCs, I'll finish with this timeframe. 
  2. Getting a high level introduction 
  3. Following recent research trends in ML feild. 
  
  **Thoughts:**

  1. Math knowledge is very important and challenging to understand. 
  2. MOOCs are effective for fast learning.
